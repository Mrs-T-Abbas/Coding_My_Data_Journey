# Data_Journey
Charting my course through the Data Science landscape. This repository contains my learning materials, code experiments, and project milestones as I navigate the path to becoming a data scientist.

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Data Science learning space! Think of this as my digital notebook, where I keep track of what I'm learning and the small projects I'm working on as a beginner.

## What's Inside

For now, you'll mostly find:

* **Notebooks (`notebooks/`):** These are like interactive documents where I write Python code and explore data.
* **Small Projects (`projects/`):** Simple projects to practice what I learn (like analyzing a small dataset or creating basic charts).
* **Code Examples (`code_examples/`):** Little bits of Python code I'm trying out.

## My Goals

My main goals here are to:

* Keep my learning organized.
* Practice coding with Python for data.
* Start building a small portfolio of things I've done.

## Exploring

Feel free to look around! If you see a notebook or project, you can click on it to see the code and what I was trying to do.

Thanks for checking out my Data Journey! ðŸ˜Š
