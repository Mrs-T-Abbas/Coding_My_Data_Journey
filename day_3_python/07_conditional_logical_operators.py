#conditional logics

#logical operators are either yes/no, true/false, 1/0

#equal to : ==
#less than: <
#greater than: >
#not equal to: !=
#less than or equal to: <=
#greater than or equal to: >=

print(4==4)
print(4<3)
print(4!=3)

#Application of logical operators
hammad_age=4
age_at_school=5
print(hammad_age==age_at_school)

#using input function and logical operators in collaboration
age_at_school= 5
hammad_age= int(input("what is your age? "))    #type conversion + input function
print(hammad_age==age_at_school)
